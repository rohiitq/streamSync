## Introduction

StreamSync is a tool designed for creators and their audience, offering a more interactive alternative to traditional super chats, which are limited to text messages. With StreamSync, users can send super chats, but with a unique twist: if the creator is interested, they can directly speak with the audience member through our extension.

Currently, we support Solana (with plans to integrate more currencies). Users can send Solana to creators, and similar to traditional super chats, messages from those who pay are prioritized—those who contribute more will have their messages featured higher. However, the payment will only be debited from the user’s account once they’ve had a conversation with the creator.

This tool is especially useful for creators in finance, ed-tech, or consultancy, allowing them to have more direct interactions with their audience while maintaining the familiar experience of super chats.

## Features

- **Personal Wallet**: Create your personal wallet to receive Solana from your audience.
- **Priority Interactions**: Prioritize interactions with top supporters.
- **Seamless Integration**: Integrate StreamSync effortlessly into your existing streaming setup.
